 In Problem_1 directory
 Component labelling results is called "res_"+ImagePath
 Eroded Labeled Components is called  "eroded_"+ImagePath
 Edge Detected Components is "edge_"+ImagePath
 Skeleton finding on Components is "skeleton_"+ImagePath
 Centroid is "centroid_"+ImagePath
 Area, orientation, and circularity (Emin/Emax),count the boundary pixels of each region, and compactness
